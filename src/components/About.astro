      Hi! Iâ€™m a freelance software engineer with a focus on computer graphics
      and web development. With an instinctive sense for design, I build
      efficient &amp; scalable systems while simplifying complex problems.
      Through my fascination with computer vision, a domain of artificial
      intelligence, I stay up to date with cutting-edge technologies to help
      clients overcome their technical hurdles.
